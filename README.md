### How to Build and Run üöÄ

To get this project up and running, you need `git` and a C++ compiler like `g++` along with `make`.

1.  **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Eslamlinux/Phone-Directory-Application-.git
    cd Phone-Directory-Application-
    ```

2.  **Compile the Code**:
    The project uses a `Makefile` to simplify compilation. Just run the `make` command.

    ```bash
    make
    ```
    This will compile the source files and create an executable named `phone_directory` in the root directory.

3.  **Run the Application**:

    ```bash
    ./phone_directory
    ```

    Once running, a menu of options will be displayed in the terminal.

4.  **Clean Up**:
    To remove the compiled object files and the executable, you can run:
    ```bash
    make clean
    ```

### Technologies Used üíª

  * **C++**: The core language of the project.
  * **`Makefile`**: For automating the build process.
  * **`fstream`**: For reading from and writing to files.
  * **`iostream`**: For standard input and output via the command line.
  * **`string`**: For handling text data and user input.
